# Online-Food-Order-Prediction-EDA
- This repository contains the code and data for a project on Online Food order Prediction of customers. The project uses the onlinefoods.csv dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harithapliyal/onlinefoods



## Installation
The following tools were used for this analysis:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Sklearn
- xgbost
- lightgbm
- catboost

- To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries by running the following command:


- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy plotly ydata_profiling XGBClassifier catboost lightgbm

    
## Usage 
- To run the analysis, simply execute the notebook. The script will generate several visualizations that help illustrate analysis of data.
## Roadmap

The analysis includes the following tasks:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Correlation analysis
- preprocessing 
- building model
- evaluating model

The analysis includes visualizations using Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn.
